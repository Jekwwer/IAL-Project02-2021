## 📋 **Assignment Overview**

**Exercises**:

1. 📘 **Hashtable**: Table with dispersed items. (3 points)
2. 📘 **Btree/Rec**: Binary search tree with recursive operations. (3.5 points)
3. 📘 **Btree/Iter**: Binary search tree with iterative operations. (3.5 points)

---

## 🛠 **Instructions**

- Implement functions in:
  - `hashtable/hashtable.c`
  - `btree/rec/btree.c`
  - `btree/iter/btree.c`
- Submit files via **IS FIT** as an uncompressed tar archive named after your login (e.g., `xlogin99.tar`). Preserve the directory structure.
- Keep UTF-8 encoding for files.
- ⚠️ **Important**: Do not modify other files or change the function prototypes.

---

## 🧪 **Testing Guidelines**

- Test implementations using the provided application.
- Available compilation commands: `make test`, `make clean`.
- Provided tests aren't exhaustive; check implementation comments and think about crafting additional tests.

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notices**

- Ensure solutions are compilable and runnable on server `eva.fit.vutbr.cz`. Infringements like skeleton modifications will result in zero points.
- Non-compilable or infinite loop solutions receive zero points; there's a time limit for tests.
- Prioritize individual work. Plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration can lead to credits denial and disciplinary measures.
