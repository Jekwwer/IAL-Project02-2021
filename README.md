Solution for the 2nd homework assignment from the course _'[IAL (Algorithms)](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/268213/)'_ for the academic year 2021/22 at VUT FIT. \
Řešení 2. domácího úkolu z předmětu _'[IAL (Algoritmy)](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/268213/.cs)'_ pro akademický rok 2021/22 na VUT FIT.

## Task: Homework Assignment #2

**Exercises:**

1. **hashtable:** Table with dispersed items. (3 points)
2. **btree/rec:** Binary search tree with recursive operations. (3.5 points)
3. **btree/iter:** Binary search tree with iterative operations. (3.5 points)

**Instructions:**

- Complete the function bodies in `hashtable/hashtable.c`, `btree/rec/btree.c`, and `btree/iter/btree.c`.
- Submit these files through IS FIT as an uncompressed tar archive named after your login (e.g., `xlogin99.tar`), preserving the directory structure.
- Maintain the UTF-8 encoding for files.
- **Do not** alter other files or modify the function prototypes.

**Testing:**

- Verify your implementations using the provided testing application.
- Compilation commands are available: `make test`, `make clean`.
- The provided tests don't cover everything that will be assessed; hence, thoroughly read the implementation comments and consider writing your own tests.

**Important Notices:**

- Your solution must be compilable and executable on the server `eva`. Non-compliance (e.g., modifying the skeleton, renaming files) will result in zero points.
- Solutions that are non-compilable or enter infinite loops will be graded zero points; tests have a time limit.
- Ensure individual work. Plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration may lead to denial of credits and potential disciplinary action.
